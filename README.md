# The Game Park

The Game Park is a web application designed to help gamers discover new and exciting video games to play. With The Game Park, users can easily search for games based on their preferred platform, genre, and other relevant criteria.

This project was developed using React 18 and Typescript, with guidance from the online tutorial course by Mosh Hamedani, #codewithmosh. While following the tutorial, I made numerous modifications to the code through self-study, resulting in a unique and personalized web application.

Special thanks to Mosh Hamedani for his excellent guidance in building this website.
